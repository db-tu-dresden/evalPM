These datasets were created by combining data from air quality monitoring stations and from weather stations in Saxony.

The source of air pollutant data and meteorological data (except rain and dew) is: Sächsisches Landesamt für Umwelt, Landwirtschaft und Geologie (https://www.umwelt.sachsen.de/umwelt/infosysteme/luftonline/Recherche.aspx)
The source of rain and dew data is: Deutscher Wetterdienst (https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/hourly/)

All times are in UTC.
PM2.5 data were only available as daily averages and have been broadcast to every hour of the corresponding day.
Dew points were calculated from temperature and relative humidity.
The weekday parameter indicates whether the corresponding day was a work day (Monday - Friday), Saturday, or Sunday/public holiday.
Units are: PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, and O3 in µg/m³; temperature and dew point in °C; wind speed in m/s; wind direction in degrees; rain and dew in mm; relative humidity in percent; atmospheric pressure in hPa; solar radiation in W/m².

The measurements from the air quality monitoring stations (on the left) have been combined with the rain measurements from the following weather stations (on the right):
Ch-Leipz: Chemnitz
Collmberg: Oschatz
DD-Berg, DD-Nord, DD-WMS: Dresden-Klotzsche
L-Mitte, L-West: Leipzig/Halle

Note that the station Ch-Leipz is missing data in the period from September 2015 to April 2016 due to a temporary destruction of the station (Source: https://publikationen.sachsen.de/bdb/artikel/36866).
Also, not all additional parameters are measured at the station Ch-Leipz, such that its dataset is kept at the basic parameters.
