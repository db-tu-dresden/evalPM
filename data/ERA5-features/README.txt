These datasets were created by calculating custom features based on ERA5 hourly data on single levels and/or on pressure levels, downloaded from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store.

Therefore, these datasets contain aggregated Copernicus Climate Change Service information [2023].
Neither the European Commission nor ECMWF is responsible for any use that may be made of the Copernicus information or data they contain.
