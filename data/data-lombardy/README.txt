These datasets were created by combining data from air quality monitoring stations and from weather stations in Lombardy, Italy.

The source of the PM2.5 and meteorological data is: ARPA Lombardia (https://www.arpalombardia.it/temi-ambientali/aria/form-richiesta-dati-stazioni-fisse/ and https://www.arpalombardia.it/temi-ambientali/meteo-e-clima/form-richiesta-dati/)

All times are in UTC.
PM2.5 data were only available as daily averages and have been broadcast to every hour of the corresponding day.
The weekday parameter indicates whether the corresponding day was a work day (Monday - Friday), Saturday, or Sunday/public holiday.
Units are: PM2.5 in µg/m³, temperature in °C, wind speed in m/s, rain in mm.
